# Wheat seed analysis
 Wheat seed analysis using R.
 
Abstract

Demand for wheat seeds is variable and maintaining its supply is crucial
to the success of seed companies and farmers.Wheat seed demand forecasting,
which can help reduce the high operational costs increased by long-period 
propagation and complex logistics has not previously been investigated yet. 
This project provides a novel perspective on wheat seed demand forecasting 
and using different types of time series models.

1. Extract data for the commodity and market for 1 year.
2. Fill in missing values by taking the average of the 3 most recent same week dayprices
3. Create a minimum of 3 time series models to predict modal price of the commodity and market
4. Evaluate the models based on the RMSE (root mean square error) and MAPE (Mean absolute percent error)


DATASET
Select a commodity and a market from the website below

TYPES OF MODELS USED FOR FORECASTING

2. Holt-exponential model
3. ARIMA model
